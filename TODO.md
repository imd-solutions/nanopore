Essential 

1. Authentication (oauth, jwt, passport, OTP)
2. Middleware/Route guard
3. GraphQL endpoint (link customer and account in one)
4. Added Zod for type checking
5. Use composables for the navigation
6. Unit tests - Vitest
7. End to end - Cypress / playwright

Nice to have

1. User information top left
2. User navigation in header
3. List other users with accordian
4. Storybook/ Histoire for component testing
5. Clean up of code
6. Notifications 
7. Finish off the task (which I am probably going to do no matter the outcome of the interview)
